## Built-in OAuth Drivers

`dropbox.js` ships with the OAuth drivers below.

### Dropbox.AuthDriver.Redirect

The recommended built-in driver for browser applications completes the OAuth
token authorization step by redirecting the browser to the Dropbox page that
performs the authorization and having that page redirect back to the
application page.

This driver's constructor takes the following options.

* `useQuery` should be set to true for applications that use the URL fragment
(the part after `#`) to store state information
* `rememberUser` can be set to true to have the driver store the user's OAuth
token in `localStorage`, so the user doesn't have to authorize the application
on every request

Although it seems that `rememberUser` should be true by default, it brings a
couple of drawbacks. The user's token will still be valid after signing out of
the Dropbox web site, so your application will still recognize the user and
access their Dropbox. This behavior is unintuitive to users. A reasonable
compromise for apps that use `rememberUser` is to provide a `Sign out` button
that calls the `signOut` method on the app's `Dropbox.Client` instance.

The [checkbox.js](../samples/checkbox.js) sample application uses
`rememberUser`, and implements signing out as described above.


### Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup

This driver may be useful for browser applications that can't handle the
redirections peformed by `Dropbox.AuthDriver.Redirect`. This driver avoids
changing the location of the application's browser window by popping up a
separate window, and loading the Dropbox authorization page in that window.

Most browsers will only display the popup window if `client.authorize()` is
called in response to a user action, such as click on a "Sign into Dropbox"
button. Browsers have different heuristics for deciding whether the condition
is met, so the safest bet is to make the `client.authorize()` call in a `click`
event listener.

To use the popup driver, create a page on your site that contains the
[receiver code](../test/html/oauth_receiver.html),
change the code to reflect the location of `dropbox.js` on your site, and point
the `Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup` constructor to it.

```javascript
client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup({
    receiverUrl: "https://url.to/oauth_receiver.html"}));
```

If your application supports Internet Explorer, the receiver code must be
served from the same origin (protocol, host, port) as your application.

The popup driver adds a `#` (fragment hash) to the receiver URL if necessary,
to ensure that the user's Dropbox uid and OAuth token are passed to the
receiver in a URL fragment. This measure may improve your users' privacy, as it
reduces the chance that their uid or token ends up in a server log.

If you have a good reason to disable the behavior above, set the `useQuery`
option to true.

```javascript
client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup({
    receiverUrl: "https://url.to/receiver.html", useQuery: true}));
```

The popup driver implements the `rememberUser` option with the same semantics
and caveats as the redirecting driver.


### Dropbox.AuthDriver.Chrome

Google Chrome [extensions](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/) and
[applications](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/) are supported by a driver
that opens a new browser tab (in the case of extensions and legacy
applications) or an application window (for new applications) to complete the
OAuth authorization.

To use this driver, first add the following files to your extension.

* the [receiver script](../test/src/helpers/chrome_oauth_receiver.coffee); the
file is both valid JavaScript and valid CoffeeScript
* the [receiver page](../test/html/chrome_oauth_receiver.html); change the page
to reflect the paths to `dropbox.js` and to the receiver script file

Point the driver constructor to the receiver page:

```javascript
client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Chrome({
  receiverPath: "path/to/chrome_oauth_receiver.html"}));
```

This driver caches the user's credentials so that users don't have to authorize
applications / extensions on every browser launch. Applications and extensions'
UI should include a method for the user to sign out of Dropbox, which can be
implemented by calling the `signOut` instance method of `Dropbox.Client`.


### Dropbox.AuthDriver.Cordova

This driver uses Cordova's
[InAppBrowser](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/2.4.0/cordova_inappbrowser_inappbrowser.md.html#InAppBrowser)
to open a popup-like activity that completes the OAuth authorization.

```javascript
client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Cordova());
```

This driver implements the `rememberUser` option with the same semantics and
caveats as the redirecting driver.


In theory, the Redirect driver should work for Cordova applications. However,
[this bug](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17327) prevents
it from working on Android, so a cross-platform application should use the
Cordova-specific driver.


### Dropbox.AuthDriver.NodeServer

This driver is designed for use in the automated test suites of node.js
applications. It completes the OAuth token authorization step by opening the
Dropbox authorization page in a new browser window, and "catches" the OAuth
redirection by setting up a small server using the `https` built-in node.js
library.

The driver's constructor takes the following options.

* `port` is the HTTP port number; the default is 8192, and works well with the
Chrome extension described below
* `favicon` is a path to a file that will be served in response to requests to
`/favicon.ico`; setting this to a proper image will avoid some warnings in the
browsers' consoles

To fully automate your test suite, you need to load up the Chrome extension
bundled in the `dropbox.js` source tree. The extension automatically clicks on
the "Authorize" button in the Dropbox token authorization page, and closes the
page after the token authorization process completes. Follow the steps in the
[development guide](./development.md) to build and install the extension.
